                <b>SAP Labs - Associate Developer (July 2021 - Present) </b>
				<p> <ul> <li> Working as an Associate Java and ABAP Developer responsible for integrating AI in the Development Landscape through service ticket intelligence.</li>
				<li> I developed an NLP-based chatbot using data from various tickets to handle development queries, that helped around 40,000 developers in SAP across multiple nations.</li>
				<li> I'm currently working on document information extraction using CV and NLP.</li> 
				<li> Also working for <font color=red> Robotic Process Automation (RPA) </font> in the Business Client Management Tool to automate manual processes like repeated user stories, consolidating data from various sources, by creating intelligent RPA bots.</li> </p> 
				</ul>
				
				<br/>
				<b>National Institute of Technology, Patna - Intern (March 2020 - Present) </b>
				<p> <ul> <li> I worked as a research assistant under Dr. Abhishek Kumar. </li>
				<li> I worked on a cough-based disease prediction system. I collected cough sound samples from a clinic and processed the audio to extract features using Python libraries (numpy, pandas, etc). Using those features, I trained models with 61% accuracy, beating the 58% state-of-the-art. </li>
				<li> I worked on detecting malware and phishing websites using automated machine learning tools (TPOT library and Google Cloud AutoML).  </li> 
				<li> I also worked on empirical analysis of ten-year bitcoin data for identifying fraudulent entities and transactions using Big Data Analytics. </li>
				</p> 
				</ul>
				
				<br/>
				
				<br/>
				<b>Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai - Technology Intern (November 2020 - June 2021) </b>
				<p> <ul> <li> I worked with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) to develop a domestic waste collection system.</li>
				<li> In Mumbai, people dumped their household waste onto a common dumping ground and the waste collection van visited only once a day. Dumping waste increases the risk of diseases. </li>
				<li> The system involved a server database with the contact details of all the residents living along the van route. On arriving in a locality, the waste collection van driver notified the residents from an Android app through SMS and push notification to submit their waste. This significantly reduced the amount of waste dumped everyday.  </li> 
				<li> As a side feature, I am currently working on automating the notifications based on GPS and identifying symbols like bus stops using CV.</li>
				</p> 
				</ul>
				
				<br/>
				
				<br/>
                <b>Samsung Research Institute Bangalore (SRI-B) - Summer Intern (May 2020 - July 2020) </b>
				<p> <ul> <li> I worked in the AI camera team for Computer Vision and image segmentation. </li>
				<li> I modified the COCO-Stuff dataset to work only with selected stuff classes (sky, water, and background) and trained a Deeplab v3+ model to segment images into these classes. I used numpy, pytorch and other python libraries.</li>
				<li> I achieved an 80.2% mIoU with DenseCRF for improved image quality. </li> 
				<li> My segmentation model was deployed in <font color=red> Bot Handy, Samsung’s state- of-the-art indoor autonomous navigation robot.</font> </li>
				</p> 
				</ul>
